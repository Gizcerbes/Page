    <p><strong>Sales rules</strong></p>
    <p>
        For your item to appear at auction, you need:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Log in to your user profile or create a new one</li>
        <li> Create a lot</li>
        <li> Wait for moderation to finish</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Lots approved by the moderator can be re-listed at the end of the auction, or after a manual stop. (Re-moderation is not required)
    </p>
    <p>
        The seller may stop bidding if there are no bids on the item.
    </p>
    <p>
        The seller can remove a lot from moderation without waiting for the verification to be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The seller may be blocked due to user complaints and will not be able to participate in the auction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inflating prices from other accounts is prohibited.
    </p>
    <p>
        One lot must contain only one product or set. Everything that is indicated in the lot is an integral trading position.
    </p>
    <p>
        The seller undertakes to sell the goods at any winning bid, even if it was the minimum bid.
    </p>
    <p>
        The product must have a complete and accurate description.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is prohibited to put up for sale:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dd>Medicines</dd>
        <dd>Drugs</dd>
        <dd>Weapons</dd>
        <dd>Explosives</dd>
        <dd>Sexual services</dd>
        <dd>Certificates and coupons</dd>
        <dd>Other items prohibited from sale or distribution in your country</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
        The seller selects the starting price, date and time of the end of the auction.
    </p>
    <p>
        The packaging price must be included in the starting price of the lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        The seller has the right to indicate possible delivery methods in the product description or clarify them in the product discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The buyer chooses the delivery method from those proposed by the seller. The buyer pays the shipping cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend picking up the goods yourself from hand to hand, or using trusted postal services.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the end of the auction, a special chat will be created between the seller and the buyer, where there will be an opportunity to discuss
        delivery methods, payment, convenient time, etc.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Purchase rules</strong></p>
    <p>
        To be able to place bets, the buyer must log into his user profile or create a new one.
    </p>
    <p>
        The buyer's bid must be higher than the current one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rate increases are only possible in whole amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cancellation of a completed bet is not permitted.
    </p>
    <p>
        By placing a bid, the buyer undertakes to buy the product if he wins, even if he changes his mind, does not read the description, does not
        clarify the necessary information in product discussions, or does not look at reviews about the seller.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the buyer has not purchased the goods, the buyer may be blocked by a complaint from the seller and will not be able to further participate
        in the auction.
    </p>
    <p>
        The buyer has no right to ask for discounts at the end of the auction.
    </p>
    <p><strong>General rules</strong></p>
    <p>
        The user has the right to add another user to the blacklist. With or without a reason.
    </p>
    <p>
        The blacklist is not subject to moderation and only affects interactions between target users.
    </p>
    <p>
        A user on the black list does not see the lots of the user who added him there, cannot send messages, cannot place bids and participate in
        discussions about lots.
    </p>
    <p>
        The user has the right to send a complaint about the item, a message in the discussion or personal correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
        Complaints require the intervention of a moderator.
    </p>
    <p>
        For unfounded complaints about other users, the user may receive punishment, including profile blocking.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users should be conscientious and correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        Treat each other with respect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Do not use profanity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Observe the rules of decency.
